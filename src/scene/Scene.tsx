        is not one polygon edge in this scene for it to smooth: everything is
        additive blobs, point sprites and lines, all of which are already
        soft-edged by their own falloff and then blurred again by bloom.

        Tone mapping is also deliberate, if less obviously so. EffectComposer
        forces gl.toneMapping to NoToneMapping while it is mounted (there is no
        prop for it), so the additive output clips instead of rolling off. That
        hard clip to white is the neon look this piece wants — the sweep and the
        rim are meant to blow out. If you ever want the filmic roll-off back,
        add a <ToneMapping mode={ToneMappingMode.ACES_FILMIC} /> effect at the
        end of this chain rather than touching the renderer.
